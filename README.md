# Weather_Image_Classification_for_Extreme_Weather_Events
A multimodal Weather Image Classification model for Extreme Weather Events that:

– Generates synthetic images using diffusion models 

– Extracts image and text embeddings with CLIP 

– Generates weather descriptions using CLIP 

– Engineers visual-numeric features

– Uses a CNN-based model to fuse image, text, and numeric data for disaster classification
